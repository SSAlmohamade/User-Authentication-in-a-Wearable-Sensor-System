# User-Authentication-in-a-Wearable-Sensor-System

By Shurook S Almohamade


We examine the implementation of behavioural biometric CA using wearable sensors, as would be found in an exoskeleton. 
We demonstrate our methods on a public dataset recorded specifically for industrial collaborative robotic applications ( we use only glove Data)
You may access the full data set from [here](https://zenodo.org/record/1472214#.YxbnJuxBy8o).
