# User-Authentication-in-a-Wearable-Sensor-System

By Shurook S Almohamade


We examine the implementation of behavioural biometric CA using wearable sensors, as would be found in an exoskeleton. 
We demonstrate our methods on a public dataset recorded specifically for industrial collaborative robotic applications (we used only E-glove Data)
You may access the full data set from [here](https://andydataset.loria.fr/).

For further information on this implementation, please refer to our paper " [Continuous User Authentication for Human-Robot Collaboration
](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3465481.3470025)".
